# Module-1-Challenge
A repository for the Module 1 Challenge
# Description
This repository contains the HTML and CSS files for the Horiseon marketing agency's home page. It also contains the images used by the HTML and CSS files to display the graphic elements and a screenshot file of what the page should look like when opened. The original code has been refactored to follow accessibility standards. It contains semantic HTML elements. It follows a logical structure. It has accessible image alt attributes. The headings are in sequential order, and there is a concise, descriptive title for the title element.
